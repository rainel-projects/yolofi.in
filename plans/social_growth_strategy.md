# Goal: Turn High-SRA Credibility into Social Traffic

**The Formula**: Traffic = (High Value Assets) x (Discoverable Funnels) -> Social Conversion.
**The Insight**: Engineers don't follow "posters". They follow **builders** who give them superpowers.

## 1. The Funnel Architecture

### Top of Funnel (Discovery)
*   **The Whitepaper (PDF)**: Distributed on HN, Reddit, Newsletters.
*   **The Article**: "Breaking the Browser Barrier" on Dev.to.
*   **The GitHub Repo**: `high-sra-architecture`.

### Middle of Funnel (Evaluation)
*   **The README**: Must link to X/LinkedIn immediately.
*   **The Code**: Clean, commented, impressive "Reference Implementation".

### Bottom of Funnel (Conversion)
*   **The CTA**: "I'm building High-SRA extensions live. Follow for Part 2."

## 2. GitHub Traffic Optimization (The Hub)

GitHub is your #1 social network. Optimize it to drive traffic to X/LinkedIn.

1.  **The Bio**:
    *   *Bad*: "Full Stack Dev."
    *   *Good*: "Building the High-SRA Zero-Risk Browser Engine. Writing about deterministic autonomy."
2.  **The Repo Header**:
    *   Add a large, clickable badges: `[ Follow updates on X ]` `[ Connect on LinkedIn ]`.
3.  **The "Sponsor" Hack**:
    *   Even if you don't want money, enable GitHub Sponsors. It puts a big pink heart on your profile.
    *   In the Sponsors description: *"I don't want money. Just follow me on X for the journey."*

## 3. The "Build in Public" Content Engine

Don't just post the final paper. Post the **struggle** and the **wins**.

### The "Screenshot Daily" Routine
*   **Day 1**: "Wrote the `integrity.worker.js`. It’s shocking how much faster DOM access is when you batch it via a Sentinel." (Attach code screenshot).
*   **Day 2**: "Designing the State Machine. Why do we let browsers rely on `useEffect` chaos? Determinism is the only way." (Attach Mermaid diagram).
*   **Day 3**: "Stress testing the engine at 10k ops/sec. UI didn't blink. High-SRA works." (Attach GIF).

### The "Reply Guy" Strategy (High Signal)
*   Find tweets by Vercel/Cloudflare engineers about "Performance".
*   Reply: *"This is exactly why I moved my diagnostic logic to a Worker. Main thread should be UI only. Wrote a whitepaper on this pattern here: [Link]"*
*   **Result**: Their followers click your link.

## 4. Execution Plan

- [ ] **Profile Upgrade**: Rewrite GitHub/X/LinkedIn bios to match the "High-SRA Architect" persona.
- [ ] **Repo CTA**: Add "Social Traffic" section to the Whitepaper README.
- [ ] **Launch Thread**: A 10-tweet thread summarizing the Whitepaper, ending with "Follow for the code drop next week."
