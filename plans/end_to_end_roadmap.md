# End-to-End Strategy: From Code to Fame

This map visualizes the complete pipeline: converting **Engineering Excellence** into **Social Recognition**.

## The Strategic Flow

1.  **The Engine (Source of Truth)**: We don't write fiction. We build the `integrity.worker` and `Sentinel` first so the Whitepaper has **real evidence** (Phase 1).
2.  **The Asset (Authority)**: We package the code into a **Whitepaper**. This elevates you from "Coder" to "Architect" (Phase 2).
3.  **The Launch (Discovery)**: We don't share the PDF directly. We share **Micro-Clips** and **Deep Dives** on HN/Reddit that point back to the GitHub Repo (Phase 3).
4.  **The Conversion (Growth)**: Everyone lands on GitHub. The README captures them with a "Follow" CTA.
