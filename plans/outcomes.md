## 🚨 Risk Assessment (What could go wrong?)
1.  **The "Silence" Risk**: No one cares about the launch.
    *   *Mitigation*: We rely on **Tier 2 (AI Directories)** which are starved for "Agent" content.
2.  **The "Troll" Risk**: HN/Reddit hate it.
    *   *Mitigation*: We nuked those platforms from the plan. We strictly stay in Safe Havens.
3.  **The "Complexity" Risk**: The code breaks.
    *   *Mitigation*: The `verification_plan.md` (Chaos Test) ensures we don't ship bugs.
