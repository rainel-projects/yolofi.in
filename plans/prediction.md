## 📅 Decade Breakdown

### Year 1-2: The "Indie" Phase (Linear Growth)
*   **Status**: Niche Tool for Performance Geeks.
*   **Revenue**: The "Bounty Cycle" works. Monthly lump sums of $1k-$2k.
*   **Outcome**: You own a profitable micro-SaaS.
*   **Risk**: Low. (Verified by "The Floor").

### Year 3-5: The "Enterprise" Phase (Exponential)
*   **Status**: Companies like Cloudflare/Vercel adopt the "Agent Pattern".
*   **Revenue**: They don't pay bounties; they pay for **Commercial Licenses** ($50k/yr contracts).
*   **Scale**: You hire 2-3 maintainers. You stop coding and start managing the Standard.

### Year 6-10: The "Exit" Phase (Dynastic Wealth)
*   **Status**: High-SRA is the default way to run AI in the browser.
*   **Scenario A (Acquisition)**: Vercel buys the IP to integrate into Next.js 20.
*   **Scenario B (DAO/Protocol)**: You decentralize it and take a % of every agent transaction.
*   **Valuation**: Technology Standards trade at 10x-50x Revenue.

## 🔮 The "Black Swan" Upside
If "Browser Agents" replace traditional UI (as predicted by OpenAI), High-SRA becomes the **Traffic Controller** of the Web.
*   **Potential**: $100M+ Valuation.
*   **Why**: You own the *Gateway* (SystemSentinel) that every Agent must pass through.

## 📉 The "Floor" (Safety)
Even if it never grows past Year 1:
*   **Result**: You made $20k/year side-income for a decade.
*   **Total**: $200k + Skill Reputation.
