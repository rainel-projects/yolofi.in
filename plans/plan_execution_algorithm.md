# The Master Algorithm: "High-SRA" Launch Sequence (Risk-Adjusted)

**Role**: Central Controller.
**Logic**: `Sequential Execution` with `Failure Mitigation`.
**Goal**: Launch a High-SRA Enterprise Asset with **100% Revenue Probability**.

---

## 🟢 PHASE 1: THE BUILD (The Enterprise Asset)
**Objective**: Build the "Proof" that sells the "Reliability".
**Ref**: `implementation_plan.md`

1.  [x] **Step 1.1**: Create `integrity.worker.js` (The Isolated Brain). *(Done)*
2.  [ ] **Step 1.2**: Create `AutonomyEngine.js` (The Fail-Open Bridge).
    *   *Risk*: Worker crashes and freezes UI.
    *   *Mitigation*: **Fail-Open Logic**. `try/catch` wraps every message. If fail -> "Safe Mode".
    *   *Outcome*: 100% Stability guarantee.
3.  [ ] **Step 1.3**: Create `SystemSentinel.js` (The Deterministic Governor).
    *   *Risk*: "Black Box" logic scares Enterprise users.
    *   *Mitigation*: **Transparent Audit Log**. Every decision must be exportable as JSON.
4.  [ ] **Step 1.4**: Build `AutonomyConsole.jsx` (The "Hacker" Dashboard).
    *   *Action*: "Export Reliability Report" button.
    *   *Revenue Hook*: Add "Supported by GitHub Sponsors" Badge.

## 🟡 PHASE 2: THE VERIFICATION (The Trust)
**Objective**: Prove it's not an AI Hallucination.
**Ref**: `verification_plan.md`

1.  [ ] **Step 2.1**: **The Chaos Test**.
    *   *Action*: Kill the Worker in DevTools.
    *   *Mitigation*: Ensure UI simply shows a "⚠️ Agent Reconnecting" badge (Zero Downtime).
2.  [ ] **Step 2.2**: **The Determinism Test**.
    *   *Action*: Replay the same state 5 times.
    *   *Mitigation*: If Hash differs, disable "Enterprise" badge automatically (Truth in Advertising).
3.  [ ] **Step 2.3**: **The Revenue Test**.
    *   *Action*: Validate the "Export PDF" looks essentially worth $5,000.

## 🔵 PHASE 3: THE AUTHORITY ASSET (The Whitepaper)
**Objective**: Position as "Enterprise Reliability" (Not "Anti-AI").
**Ref**: `whitepaper_plan.md` & `project_evolution.md`

1.  [ ] **Step 3.1**: Capture "Proof" Screenshots (Simulated Traffic vs 60fps).
2.  [ ] **Step 3.2**: Write "High-SRA: The Deterministic Browser Agent".
    *   *Risk*: Ignored as "another AI tool".
    *   *Mitigation*: Use **"Control Theory"** framing. Talk about "Safety", not "Intelligence".
3.  [ ] **Step 3.3**: Create "The 10 Micro-Pieces" for social.
4.  [ ] **Step 3.4**: SEO Optimize README with "Zero-Risk" keywords.

## 🟣 PHASE 4: THE REVENUE SETUP (Zero Cost)
**Objective**: Open the shop.
**Ref**: `revenue_plan.md`

1.  [ ] **Step 4.1**: Enable GitHub Sponsors.
2.  [ ] **Step 4.2**: Add "Consulting Services - Architecture Audits" to Bio.
3.  [ ] **Step 4.3**: **The Reverse Bounty Post**.
    *   *Risk*: No one sponsors.
    *   *Mitigation*: **Protocol A (Feature Lock)**. "Feature X is built *only* when $1k is raised."

---

## 🔴 PHASE 5: THE LAUNCH (X-Only Protocol)
**Objective**: 10,000 Impressions on X (Twitter).
**Ref**: `launch_multiplier_strategy.md`

1.  [ ] **Step 5.1 (Day 1)**: **The Asset Setup**.
    *   *Action*: Optimize Bio ("High-SRA Architect").
    *   *Action*: Pin "The Master Thread" (Visual Proof).
2.  [ ] **Step 5.2 (Day 1)**: **The Offensive**.
    *   *Action*: Execute "Reply Guy" strategy on 5 accounts (`vercel`, `reactjs`, etc).
    *   *Goal*: Siphon traffic to Pinned Tweet.
3.  [ ] **Step 5.3 (Day 2)**: **The Fail-Safe (Protocol X)**.
    *   *Logic*: If views < 1k, Delete & Repost with "Revenue" Hook.


---

## 🔮 PHASE 6: THE PREDICTION ENFORCER (100% Probability)
**Objective**: Make `prediction.md` unavoidable.
**Fail-Safe Logic**: `If (Metric < Predicted) { Force_outcome }`

### 📉 Failure Mode 1: "The Ghost Town" (No Users)
*   *Why it happens*: Algorithm hates us.
*   *Mitigation*: **Tier 7 (Video Demos)**.
*   *Action*: Record a TikTok/Reel: "Killing my Browser Agent to prove it's safe." (Visuals always win).
*   *New Probability*: High.

### 📉 Failure Mode 2: "The Free-Rider" (No Revenue)
*   *Why it happens*: People love the code but don't pay.
*   *Mitigation*: **Protocol A (Feature Lock)**.
*   *Action*: Move "Traffic Simulator" behind a $5/mo GitHub Sponsor wall.
*   *Calculated Probability*: Power users *need* the tool -> They *must* pay.

### 📉 Failure Mode 3: "The Total Fail" (Project Dies)
*   *Why it happens*: Market shift or boredom.
*   *Mitigation*: **Protocol B (Asset Liquidation)**.
*   *Action*: Sell the Repo (Code + Stars + Whitepaper) on **Microns.io**.
*   *Floor Value*: $2,000 - $5,000.
*   *Probability of Sale*: ~100% for high-quality, starred repos.
