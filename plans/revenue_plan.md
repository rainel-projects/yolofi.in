# Goal: Zero-Cost, High-Margin Revenue

**Constraint**: $0 Upfront Investment.
**The Asset**: "High-SRA Architecture" (Intellectual Property).
**The Model**: Monetize the *Trust* and the *Expertise*, not just the lines of code.

## 1. The "Open Core" Model (Passive Licensing)
**Concept**: The Engine (`integrity.worker.js`) is Free (MIT). The *Enterprise Adapters* are Paid.
**Why it works**: Enterprises pay for "Integration", not "Innovation".
**Zero Cost**: You only build the adapter if they ask for it.

### Product Ladder:
*   **Tier 1: Community (Free)**
    *   The Standard High-SRA Engine.
    *   MIT License.
    *   Public Support (GitHub Issues).
*   **Tier 2: Enterprise (Commercial License - $499/yr)**
    *   "Audit-Ready" Certification (PDF Report Generation).
    *   `Splunk`/`Datadog` Integration Adapter.
    *   SLA-backed Support.

## 2. The "Architect-on-Retainer" (High Ticket Service)
**Concept**: Sell the *implementation* of High-SRA, not the software.
**Why it works**: CTOs read the Whitepaper and want "Zero-Risk" for *their* specific app.
**Revenue**: $2,000 - $5,000 per Audit/Consultation.
**Zero Cost**: You sell your time and the PDF methodology you already wrote.

### The Offering:
*   **"System Integrity Audit"**: Review their frontend for Main Thread blocking risks.
*   **"Worker Migration Plan"**: A roadmap to move their diagnostics to a Worker (using your patterns).

## 3. GitHub Sponsors (The "Tip Jar" on Steroids)
**Concept**: Monetize your "Thought Leadership".
**Why it works**: If your Whitepaper helps a dev get a promotion, they will sponsor you.
**Zero Cost**: Enable the button on GitHub.

### Tiers:
*   **$5/mo**: "Supporter" (Badge).
*   **$50/mo**: "Insider" (Early access to new Whitepaper drafts).
*   **$500/mo**: "Corporate Sponsor" (Logo on the Repo README).

## 4. The "Bounty" Strategy (Reverse Revenue)
**Concept**: Let companies pay you to build features *they* need.
**Execution**:
*   Post on the Repo: *"Feature X (Cloudflare integration) is planned. Sponsorship of $1,000 fast-tracks it."*
*   **Result**: You get paid *before* you build.

## Execution Summary (Zero Risk)

1.  **Step 1**: Enable GitHub Sponsors (Day 1).
2.  **Step 2**: Add "Commercial Support Available" line to README (Day 1).
3.  **Step 3**: Meaningful Revenue -> Wait for the first "Enterprise Inquiry" from your Whitepaper traffic, *then* quote the $5k Audit.
